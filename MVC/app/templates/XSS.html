						<h2>
							<center><u>XSS</u></center>
						</h2>
						<br><br>


						Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy,
						which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access
						any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.
						<br><br>
						Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the
						application.
						<br> <br>
						You can see below an illustration showing how does it works:
						<br><br>
						An attacker can change the URL to look like this:
						<br> <br>

							Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:
							<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								1. Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
							</li>
							<li>
								2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							<br><br>
							The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost
							limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on
							the user’s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.
							<br><br>
							XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: stored and reflected. There is a third, much less well-known type of XSS attack called <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS"> DOM</a> based XSS.
							<br><br>

							<b>Stored XSS attacks</b>
							<br><br>
							Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server
							when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS.
							<br><br>
							<b>Blind Cross-site Scripting</b>
							<br><br>
							Blind Cross-site Scripting is a form of persistent XSS. It generally occurs when the attacker’s payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application.
							<br>
							For example in feedback forms, an attacker can submit the malicious payload using the form, and once the backend user/admin of the application will open the attacker’s submitted form via the backend application, the attacker’s payload
							will get executed. Blind Cross-site Scripting is hard to confirm in the real-world scenario but one of the best tools for this is XSS Hunter.
							<br><br>
							<b>Reflected XSS attacks</b>
							<br><br>
							Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as part of the request.
							<br>
							Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website. When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a specially crafted form, or even just browsing
							to a malicious site, the injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code because it came from a “trusted” server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes
							referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-II XSS.
